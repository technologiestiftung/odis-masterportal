The selection of an Open Data category can then be made independently of the publication as Open Data. If no category is assigned to a data set, the data set will be displayed in the topic tree under Miscellaneous.<br/> We have chosen the Open Data categories because the data in the Transparency Portal is also sorted according to these categories and many data sets are already categorized accordingly.<br/> Alternatively, the tree can also be structured according to the INSPIRE categories.",
