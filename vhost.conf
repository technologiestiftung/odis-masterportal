    # The ProxyPass directive specifies the mapping of incoming requests to the backend server (or a cluster of servers known as a Balancer group).
    # It proxies the requests only with matching URI “/blog”

    ProxyPass /geodienste_hamburg_de https://geodienste.hamburg.de
    ProxyPass /metaver_de https://metaver.de

    #To ensure that and Location: headers generated from the backend are modified to point to the reverse proxy, instead of back to itself, #the ProxyPassReverse directive is most often required:

    ProxyPassReverse /geodienste_hamburg_de https://geodienste.hamburg.de
    ProxyPassReverse /metaver_de https://metaver.de
